# Welcome to Markit
<h2>Image-based brand logo similarity search project using GCP to check trademark infringement in seconds!✨</h2>

Markit is a GCP-based interactive WebApp that enables users to quickly check✔️ how similar your brand logo is to a registered, pre-existing logo.

It also classifies the category of your brand logo based on official Vienna Code Classification(VCL). 

To see results, drag-and-drop an image of your logo to the designated area or click to manually choose file from a popup.

You should be able to see the top 3 similar brand logo images, along with the top 3 match categories.

If you don't have an image of your logo in an appropriate format, that's ok! 

Markit also supports direct upload of photos from your phone, although we suggest a file size no larger than 5MB for optimal results. 

Please check out https://markit-live-v2.uc.r.appspot.com/ for an active demo!
