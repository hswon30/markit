# Markit
An image-based brand logo similarity search project using GCP to check trademark infringement in seconds!✨

![Markit logo](https://github.com/hswon30/markit/blob/070455905658f00637200c1e4a2b33dc7f4338fb/markit_logo.jpg)

Markit is a GCP-based interactive WebApp that enables users to quickly check✔️ how similar your brand logo is to a registered, pre-existing logo.

It also classifies the category of your brand logo based on official Vienna Code Classification(VCL). 

To see results, drag-and-drop an image of your logo to the designated area or click to manually choose file from a popup.

You should be able to see the top 3 similar brand logo images, along with the top 3 match categories.

If you don't have an image of your logo in an appropriate format, that's ok! 

Markit also supports direct upload of photos from your phone, although we suggest a file size no larger than 5MB for optimal results.
