# Welcome to Markitüîé
Image-based brand logo similarity search project using GCP to check trademark infringement in seconds!‚ú®

Markit is a GCP-based interactive WebApp enabling users to quickly check‚úîÔ∏è how similar their brand logo is to registered, pre-existing logos.

Markit also classifies the category of the input brand logo based on the official Vienna Code Classification(VCL). 

To see the results, drag and drop an image of your logo to the designated area or click to manually upload file from a popup.

You should be able to see the top 3 similar brand logo images, along with the top 3 matching categories.

If you don't have an image of your logo in an appropriate format, that's ok too! 

Markit also supports direct upload of photos from your phone, although we suggest a file size no larger than 5MB for optimal results.
